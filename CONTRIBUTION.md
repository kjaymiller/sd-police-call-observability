# Contribution Guidelines

## Contributing vs Forking

This project is mostly to create a unique way to optimize San Diego Police Department Calls for Service Records.

If you intend to expand this to new locations/scopes of reporting, consider forking this repo and branching off of that fork.

## Formating

Format your python code using [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).

## Making a Contribution

To make sure that folks are addressing issues in a unified, non-competitive way please check [issues](https://github.com/kjaymiller/sd-police-call-observability/issues)
before adding a new feature or correction. If no feature exists then create one and assign the issue to yourself.

Be sure to create a fork and submit a pull-request with a link to the addressed issue. 

Please address a single issue per pull request (for the sake of cleanliness)

## Testing
This project is tested using pytest.

Issues labelled `bug`, `enhancement` should have a test with the failed test-case added and the test should be passing with your new code.
